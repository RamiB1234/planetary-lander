# Planetary Lander
This is my participation to the Space Apps Saudi Challenge 2021. 
I have chosen the [Planetary Lander Video Game Challenge](https://spaceappssaudi.com/en/challenges/challenge-15) and I've developed a demo game for it.

# How to Play
NASA is retuning to the moon in 2024 (ARTEMIS PLAN). You have to help the crew to land safely.
 
Use arrow keys to control the lander. Avoid hitting floating meteoroids. The goal is to land successfully on the surface of the moon
